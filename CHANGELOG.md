# Updates
All releases can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/RoanH/KeysPerSecond/releases).

## [v8.9] 22nd of January, 2024: Cursor Graph
This is a small release that adds one new major feature and fixes a number of regressions in the previous release that were thankfully caught early by UlyssesZh.

- Added a new graph type that tracks the movement path of the cursor as shown below. Note that a fast update rate is recommended when using this graph type to make it look smooth (50ms - 10ms).
![cursor graph](https://media.roanh.dev/keyspersecond/cursorgraph.gif)
- The backlog for the old graph type (line graph) is now specified in milliseconds instead of update frames.
- The reset and reload command keys are now unbound by default since these are semi destructive and could be triggered by accident.
- Fix that the graph was rendered 1 pixel smaller than it was supposed to be.
- Show a warning when reloading a configuration file that cannot be reloaded (config not loaded from a file).
- Fix a config desync when loading a configuration via the initial dialog.
- Fix that certain settings are not being applied when loading a config via the default option or the command line ([92](https://github.com/RoanH/KeysPerSecond/issues/92)).
- Fix that periodic stats saving saves to the base folder instead of a file inside that folder ([93](https://github.com/RoanH/KeysPerSecond/issues/93)).
- Thanks to efojug fix that the application can initially be offscreen on some monitor layouts ([94](https://github.com/RoanH/KeysPerSecond/issues/94) and [95](https://github.com/RoanH/KeysPerSecond/pull/95)).
- Fix that some settings do not get applied properly when reloading a configuration file.
- Ensure that the directory stats are being saved to actually exists before saving.

- It is now possible to set a default configuration that will be loaded automatically when starting KeysPerSecond ([20](https://github.com/RoanH/KeysPerSecond/issues/20) and [89](https://github.com/RoanH/KeysPerSecond/issues/89)).

- Actually reset the total number of hits when loading a new configuration.
- Fix loading several configurations in a row and then adding a key creating a lot of empty layout space.

## [v8.0] 12th of September, 2018: The Layout Update
This is a major release that completely changes the layout system of the program.
You are now able to design basically any layout of the panels as long as it aligns to the grid of the program.

**Note however that because of this the old configuration format does not load completely anymore!**
If you never changed any of the layout settings your configuration will load just fine, however if you made
changes to the layout chances are that it won't look exactly the same in this version (though since more is possible now you can fix your layout to look the same again or improve it). It should also be noted that the panels have a slightly different size (changed by a few pixels).

Example of what you can do now:    
![layout](https://i.imgur.com/2HgRJwO.png)

Changes:
- Grid based layout editor that shows layout changes in real time (if opened from the right click menu) and that allows custom panel sizes
- Rendering modes can now be set on a per panel basis
- Overall improved performance
- Removed the size setting

P.S. Since the layout system is completely new I expect there to be at least a few bugs that slipped past my testing.

## [v7.4] 3rd of June, 2018: Small fixes
- Add the GitHub link to the initialisation dialog.
- Fix the configuration file not supporting UTF-8 characters.
